# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects youâ€™re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.
Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data science. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge.

In this Data Science Project I will be applying Machine Learning techniques to classify whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.

*Dataset*

The dataset used here is Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have attached the csv file needed for the regression task - heart.csv The same can also be found here Dataset file: "C:\Users\siddarth r\Downloads\heart.csv"

1. age
2. sex
